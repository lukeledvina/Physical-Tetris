# game.gd manages all of the components under it, connecting them accordingly.

# a block spawner component will need to spawn blocks and put them as children of
# the PlayerController.
# A signal will need to be sent to the PlayerController to know to grab control of the new block



# Use this script to connect the functionality of child components. Don't have it be full of a ton of different functionality
