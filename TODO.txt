block rotation
	fix collisions after rotation (arrays are empty after rotation as soon as they are put into ray_cast_container_array)
	need to check if it is possible for the blocks to rotate before rotating
score system

material properties


CREATE SETTERS FOR ROTATE LEFT AND RIGHT AND DOWN, ALL AS ONE FUNCTION, TO CHECK THE
SAME LOGICAL EXPRESSION


decide where the reaction logic will take place, on the blocks themselves, etc...

how will reactions act, take the entire block, or just sections of blocks...?
if colliding with multiple materials, which reactions take precedence...?


decide how to architect the blocks, each has four single tetris blocks


how to move blocks (when to stop them),
	i think have collision on all of them
	but use rays when a timer goes off to detect if it can go down again
	or if it needs to stop moving and check for reactions at that point
	
	this is because as the shape rotates, what will be considered its "bottom"
	will change
