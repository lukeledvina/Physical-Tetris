block rotation
	need to check if it is possible for the blocks to rotate before rotating
		if it rotates and is inside of another collision shape, shift it to the side that is not in the collision shape (left or right)
		also if it rotates into something below it, push it up 32px

score system

material properties



decide where the reaction logic will take place, on the blocks themselves, etc...

how will reactions act, take the entire block, or just sections of blocks...?
if colliding with multiple materials, which reactions take precedence...?
